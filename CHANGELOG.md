# Changelog

### 1.1.0

#### Potentially breaking changes

- Haxroomie is now released to `npm` and installing with git is no longer recommended.
- Config is now loaded from `~/.haxroomie/config.js` by default. If `~/.haxroomie/config.js` does not exist, one is created from an example config.
- The `user-data-dir` is now loaded from `~/.haxroomie/user-data-dir` by default. Copy your `user-data-dir` there or use the `-d` argument for haxroomie if you have some data you do not want to loose.
- The `banlist` command is now hidden in CLI unless you load the `hr/kickban` plugin from [my plugin repository](https://github.com/morko/hhm-sala-plugins) (also the `!kick`, `!ban` and `!banlist` commands in the room won't exist if this plugin is not loaded)
- In API the `RoomController.openRoom` method now throws an Error if it fails to open the room.
- The API of `RoomController` has changed so that now the methods can throw bunch of custom errors for better error handling. Please review the new API at [documentation website](https://morko.github.io/haxroomie/RoomController.html).

\* *`~` is a shorthand for users home directory in Linux*

#### Migration guide from 1.0.x => 1.1.0

1. Copy your config to `~/.haxroomie/config.js`.
2. Copy the `user-data-dir` in the `haxroomie` folder to `~/.haxroomie/user-data-dir`.
3. Follow installatin instructions in [README](https://github.com/morko/haxroomie#installation)

#### New features (CLI)

- Can now "hot load" the config using `reload` command if only `pluginConfig` is changed. This means that you can change the plugin configurations without restarting the room.
- The `plugins` option "overrides" the `pluginConfig` so that plugins will get loaded from the filesystem if both options contain the same plugin. The configurations in `pluginConfig` now affect the `plugins` loaded from filesystem.
- Can use `roomScript` with `plugins`.
- users can now give the token in the config file using `token` option
- when opening rooms the token will be reused until it becomes invalid
- `reload` command now gives better user feedback
- users can now also use plugins with the `roomScript` option
  - only the default plugins will be disabled
- tried to elaborate what is a room id in `help`
- support using `.env` file in projects root directory to be able to set environment variables
